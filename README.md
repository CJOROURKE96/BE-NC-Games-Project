To run this project locally, you will need to add two .env files. 

These two files are:

.env.development
.env.test

Both files must include a reference to the database we're working on using PGDATABASE=data_base_name

In this case;

.env.development: should contain PGDATABASE=nc_games
.env.test: should contain PGDATABASE=nc_games_test
